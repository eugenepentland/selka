# Implementation progress

The objective remains the complete scalar MVP in plan sections 4–13. The later
features in sections 15 and 18 remain proposed experiments, as specified by the
plan. This checkpoint does not claim the MVP is complete.

## 2026-09-05: M0 and M1

Implemented the initial vertical slice in the separate `mylang` repository.
At the user's request, pinned Guardian's exact installed Zig snapshot:
`0.17.0-dev.1683+5ceec001b`. Updated both the working plan and original attached
plan to record that toolchain decision.

Evidence:

- `zig build test --summary all`: 13/13 tests pass (9 core, 4 CLI).
- `zig build test -Doptimize=ReleaseFast --summary all`: the same 13/13 pass.
- `zig build fmt-check --summary all`: passes.
- `zig build run -- run examples/arithmetic.my`: prints `7`.
- CLI tests spawn the compiler built in the selected host optimization mode.
- Allocation-failure testing exercises request creation, compilation, execution,
  and disassembly with the testing allocator. Core malformed-source and runtime
  trap cases also release request and VM storage.

The tests exposed an allocating-writer error that needed conversion back to
`OutOfMemory`, and a test runner path that needed resolution before changing the
child working directory. Both were fixed and the suites rerun.

CI is configured for the same Debug/ReleaseFast commands and exact manifest
toolchain. No remote repository or hosted CI run has been created. Guardian's
repository and gates were not modified or exercised by these builds.

## 2026-09-05: M2

Implemented booleans, initialized locals, optional annotations, assignment,
nested scopes, unary negation/not, comparisons, and advisory binding warnings.
The frontend now has separate expression and statement tables. Semantic
checking resolves each binding to a unique local slot, and the VM stores typed
local values. Source lifetime and explicit allocation ownership are unchanged.

Verified the minimum-integer literal exception (including parentheses),
negation overflow, active-shadowing rejection, sibling-scope name reuse,
immutability, unknown names, type mismatches, warning ordering, and initializer
traps despite unused-binding warnings. A 4,096-term expression exercises the
iterative semantic/lowering walks. Updated the return instruction's source
mapping to the actual return statement.

Evidence:

- Debug: `zig build test --summary all` passes 20/20 tests (15 core, 5 CLI).
- ReleaseFast: the same 20/20 tests pass.
- Formatting check passes.
- `zig build run -- run examples/locals.my` prints `21`.
- The testing allocator covers allocation failures through scope checking,
  warning rendering, and local-value execution, as well as the original pipeline.

## Remaining milestones

- M3: branches, loops, signed division/remainder, explicit discard, short-circuit
  lowering, return analysis, and instruction budgets.
- M4: signature collection, direct/recursive calls, explicit VM frames, frame
  budgets, and guest call traces.
- M5: complete fixture matrix, parser/host-failure robustness, documentation,
  and a requirement-by-requirement audit of the full MVP in Debug/ReleaseFast.
